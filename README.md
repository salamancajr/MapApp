## Initialize
Everyone must run this script at first.
```bash
sh shell/init.sh
```

## Daily coding
We have prepared everything for you. You just need run script below:
```bash
npm start
```

## Build app
Before build app, you should create signature for android
```bash
  sh shell/android/signature.sh
```
Before build app, you should create personal certificate and upload to [apple developer](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/certificate). Or create by xcode automatically.

And then you can build
```bash
sh shell/archive.sh
```

## Upload to App Store
You can use Xcode -> Product -> Archive, and click `Upload to App Store` when complete.

Also, you can use shell script.
```bash
sh shell/archive.sh && sh shell/ios/upload-app-store.sh
```
In this way, you should override teamID in file `ios/exportOptions/app-store.plist`, go to [apple developer](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/identifier/bundle) to fetch the keyword named: Prefix
